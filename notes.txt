//  zustand:
     Core Concepts
     Store:
     A store is a JavaScript object that holds your state and actions (functions to update the state).
     You create a store using the create function from Zustand.

     State:
     The data you want to manage globally (e.g., cart items, user info).

     Actions:
     Functions that update the state.

     Hooks:
     Zustand provides a useStore hook to access the state and actions in your components.
